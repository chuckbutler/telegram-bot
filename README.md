Octobot
============

A Telegram Bot (FORK) based on [Yagop's Telegram Bot](http://git.io/6jdjGg).

Enable more [`plugins`](https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot/tree/master/plugins)
-------------
See the plugins list with `!plugins` command.

Enable a disabled plugin by `!plugins enable [name]`.

Disable an enabled plugin by `!plugins disable [name]`.

Those commands require a privileged user, privileged users are defined inside `data/config.lua` (generated by the bot), stop the bot and edit if necessary, or ask a sudo user to add you.


Working on a fork?
-----------------

The process to ensure your repo doesn't collide when making a feature/bugfix is simple.
Assuming you already have the repository checked out from YOUR fork... do the following

    git checkout master
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/chuckbutler/telegram-bot.git
    git pull upstream master
    git push origin master
    git checkout -b my-feature
    *hack hack hack*
    git push origin my-feature

now open a pull request targeting master, and someone will be along shortly to
evaluate your contribution.

Thanks for caring enough to share and help make Octobot better!

Build / Docker stuff now?
-----------------

Yep! this bot runs in docker. If you want to run it you'll have to hack on your
own credentials and get things setup. if you follow and poke around the source
i'm sure you'll figure it out.

Enjoy :)
